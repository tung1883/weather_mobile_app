In this school project, we develop a mobile app to forecast weather
Framework: React Native and Expo
APIs: Open Weather App (huge help!) and Google API

Make sure you have your own API keys and put them in the .env file, like this:
API_KEY=OPEN_WEATHER_APP_KEY
GOOGLE_KEY=GOOGLE_API_KEY

After cloning the project, run:

```
    npm install
    npx expo install
```

to install the modules

To run the project, run:

```
    npx expo start
```
